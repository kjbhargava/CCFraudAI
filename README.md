# CCFraudAI
An ML repository practicing ML techniques on a dataset on Credit Card fraud provided by Kaggle.  ML techniques used are: Logistic regression, SVC, Nearest Neighbor.  Used random undersampling, correlation heatmap, etc for exploratory data analysis.

Current issue: unable to import imblearn and so created a manual SMOTE oversampler, but now cannot implement it into a ML pipeline.  WIll update when issue is resolved.
